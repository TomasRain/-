# Group Project Starter

This repository is a simple placeholder for a group project. It includes a starter README that you can expand as the project takes shape.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Add code or documentation as needed.
4. Commit and push your changes, then open a pull request.

## Project Ideas
- Build a small web app that tracks team tasks.
- Prototype a data analysis notebook.
- Experiment with a new framework and share learnings.

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
- Use pull requests for every change so teammates can review.
- Document any setup steps or decisions in this README.

## Next Steps
- Decide on the project scope with your team.
- Add initial code structure (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`).
- Define coding standards and testing expectations.
